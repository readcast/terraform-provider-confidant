## Code Review
All pull requests will be reviewed by someone on Stripe's Cloud team.

There's no need to pick a reviewer; if you submit a pull request, we'll see it and figure out who should review it.

## Help us help you!
We highly recommend [allowing edits from maintainers](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/) (ie, us) to your branch. Allowing us to edit your branch means that we can rebase and fix any merge conflicts for you.
